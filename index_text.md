The purpose of this web app is to demonstrate how my competencies match with the ones required for the Senior Data Analyst position your company recently advertised.

To summarize the job ad, the required candidate will:

 - **Be an excellent communicator who can drive the full cycle of analytics workflow, from requirement gathering, to data collection, reporting and visualization.**
 - **Identify and analyze trends and shifts in customer behavior, both independently and in collaboration with business stakeholders**
 - **Have a keen eye for detail and ensure that numbers always add up**
 - **Have strong presentation skills with the ability to create beautiful charts and slide decks**  
have:
 - **2-4 years experience in an analytics or data related role**
 - **Excellent SQL and data modeling skills**
 - **Fluency with Excel/Google Sheets functions (pivot tables, vlookups, sumifs etc)**
 - **Tableau or similar dashboarding tool experience**
 - **Outstanding communication skills and experience presenting results.**

I have carefully designed this web app to clearly prove my ability in each of these requirements.

 - The [**Analysis**](/apps/analysis) part of the app is a Jupyter Notebook in which I analyzed e-commerce data for a gift online store from the United Kingdom. This was the dataset which matched your business model closely that I could find on short notice. In the notebook, I answered the business questions which were raised in your job ad. My tool of choice was Python. I am also equally competent in spreadsheet technologies but I felt that for the sake of consistency (and speed of deploymeny), it was better to do this entire project using one tool.
 - The [**Dashboard**](/apps/dashboard) part of the app is a dashboard which demonstrates my ability to communicate results, while at the same time fulfilling the requirement of "Tableau or similar dashboarding tool experience". I built this dashboard, along with the rest of this app, using the Python Dash Plotly library.

Both the notebook and the dashboard shouldn't take more than 10 minutes of your time so please do go through them. I would be happy to answer any further questions about my skills and experience in an interview.
